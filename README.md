### What does this project do?                                                   

Quickly build a subscription based website, taking variable monthly payments.

- You have a subscription service to sell
- Each of your packages have unique selling points (USPs)
- Each have a different reoccurring price

Use Subscribie to build your subscription model business & test your market.

# Why is this project useful?                                                    

A lot of the hard work has been done for you. If you're a devloper, you can
impress your clients quickly, if you're a small business owner, you might want
to try the [subscription website hosting service](http://subscriptionwebsitebuilder.co.uk) but you can always host it yourself too.

- Low risk (not very expensive)
- No coding required
- Simple: Just give us your USPs for each service & price
- Upload your pictures
- Choose between Stripe & Gocardless (more coming soon!) 

An abstraction layer for managing variable recurring subscriptions and billing. Abstracts direct debit and token based card payment providers or payment-institutions.

# JWT auth
First authenticate, which will give you a token.
Oauth style login:

```
curl -v -d "fred=me@example.com" -d "password=password" http://127.0.0.1:5000/auth/jwt-login
```
Http Basic auth login:

```
curl -v --user "fred" http://127.0.0.1:5000/auth/jwt-login
```

Then use the bearer token in a request to a protect path.
e.g.
```
curl -v -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" http://127.0.0.1:5000/auth/protected
```
