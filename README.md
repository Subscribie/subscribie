## What does this project do?
Use Subscribie to collect recurring payments online.

Quickly build a subscription based website, taking weekly/monthly/yearly payments- including one-off charges.

- You have subscription service(s) to sell (plans)
- Each of your plans have unique selling points (USPs)
- Each have a different recurring price, and/or an up-front charge

# Demo & Hosting

# Why is this project useful?                                                    

A lot of the hard work has been done for you. If you're a devloper, you can
impress your clients quickly, if you're a small business owner, you might want
to try the [subscription website hosting service](http://subscriptionwebsitebuilder.co.uk) but you can always host it yourself too.

- Low risk (not very expensive)
- No coding required
- Simple: Just enter your plans & prices
- Upload a picture
- Uses Stripe for subscriptions & one-off payments

# Contributing & Help finding things: Where do I find x? Where is file y?

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) and quickstart below.

# Quickstart (without Docker)

```
git clone https://github.com/Subscribie/subscribie.git
cd subscribie
cp .env.example .env # Copy default .env settings (read it)
# Read the .env file so you're familiar with the env variables
```

(Optional) Set database path. Edit `.env` and set `DB_FULL_PATH` and `SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI`. (optional but recommended- do not store data.db in /tmp).

> Notice that `sqlite:///` starts with *three* forward slashes. So, if you want to store the database in `/home/sam/data.db` then,
you should put `sqlite:////home/sam/data.db` (note four `/`'s)

```
# Open the .env file, and change the database path to store somewhere else (e.g. your `/home/Documents/data.db` folder):

DB_FULL_PATH="/tmp/data.db"
SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI="sqlite:////tmp/data.db"
```

Create python environment and run flask:
```
python3 -m venv venv # Create a python3.x virtual environment
. venv/bin/activate # Activate the virtualenv
# If you are on Windows, use: . venv/Scripts/Activate 
pip install -r requirements.txt # Install requirements
export FLASK_APP=subscribie
export FLASK_DEBUG=1
flask db upgrade
flask initdb # (recommended- gives you some example data)
```

The database file is called `data.db`. Note,
`flask initdb` inserts pretend data into your database for testing.

### Set Stripe API key
You need a Stripe api key.

1. Create a stripe account
2. Go to api keys https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys (test mode)
3. Copy `Publishable key` and `Secret key`
4. Paste the keys into your `.env` file:

Edit your .env file
```
STRIPE_TEST_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_<your-Publishable-key>
STRIPE_TEST_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_<your-Secret-key>
```

## Start Subscribie
```
export FLASK_APP=subscribie
export FLASK_DEBUG=1
flask run
```
Now visit http://127.0.0.1:5000

# Quickstart (with Docker)

If you like to use docker-compose workflow for local development:

```
git clone https://github.com/Subscribie/subscribie.git
cd subscribie
cp .env.example .env
export COMPOSE_DOCKER_CLI_BUILD=1
export DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1

# Start the container
docker-compose up

# Wait for it to build...
```

Then visit http://127.0.0.1:5000

To go inside the container, you can do: `docker-compose exec web /bin/bash` 
from the project root directory.

# Logging & Debugging - How to change the logLevel
Quick: edit your `.env` file and set `PYTHON_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG`.

E.g. to reduce the amount of logs, to `WARNING` or `CRITICAL`.

The default log level is `DEBUG` which means show as much logging
information as possible.

The possible values are DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL
See https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging.html

Flask *does* need to be restarted for the log level to change.


# How to change theme (theme development)

### How to change from the default jesmond theme to the builder theme.

1. Edit your `.env` file

Change:

- `THEME_NAME="jesmond"` to `THEME_NAME="builder"`
- **(optional)** change `TEMPLATE_BASE_DIR` if you want to store themes in a different directory.

2. Stop & start subscribie

3. Complete. The other theme will now load

#### Create a new theme

If you're creating a *new* theme, then change `TEMPLATE_BASE_DIR` to a directory **outside** of 
subscribie root project.


# API based authentication with jwt token

#### Locally
Locally you'll need to create public/private keys for secure
jwt authentication.

1) Generate public/private keys automatically

```
# Use the commands below to automaticaly create 'private.pem' file and key
openssl genrsa -out private.pem 2048
# Use this command to automatically generate your public.pem
openssl rsa -in private.pem -pubout > public.pem
```

2) Update .env file with PRIVATE_KEY and PUBLIC_KEY

```
PRIVATE_KEY="/path/to/private.pem"
PUBLIC_KEY="/path/to/public.pem"
```
## Logging in via jwt or basic auth

Provide the username & password in a POST request, and a jwt token is returned for 
use in further requests. 

# API Basics

## Oauth style login:

```
curl -v -d "username=admin@example.com" -d "password=password" http://127.0.0.1:5000/auth/jwt-login
```
## Http Basic auth login:

```
curl -v --user "fred:password" http://127.0.0.1:5000/auth/jwt-login
```

Then use the bearer token in a request to a protect path.
e.g.
```
curl -v -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" http://127.0.0.1:5000/auth/protected
```

## Get all plans

```
curl -v -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer <token> " http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/plans
```

## Create Plan 

Example POST request:
```
    curl -v -H "Content-Type: application/json" 
    -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" -d '
    {
      "interval_unit": "monthly",
      "interval_amount": "599",
      "sell_price": 0,
      "title": "My title",
      "requirements": {
        "instant_payment": false,
        "subscription": true,
        "note_to_seller_required": false
      },
      "selling_points": [
        {"point":"Quality"}
      ]
    }' http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/plan
```

## Update Plan

Example PUT request:
```
    curl -v -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -X PUT 
    -d '
    {
      "title":"Coffee", 
      "interval_unit": "monthly", 
      "selling_points": [
        {"point":"Quality"}, 
        {"point": "Unique blend"}
      ], 
      "interval_amount":888, 
      "requirements": {
        "instant_payment": false, 
        "subscription": true, 
        "note_to_seller_required": false}
    }' 
    http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/plan/229
```

## Delete Plan

Example DELETE request:
```
curl -v -X DELETE -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/plan/229
```

# Database

The database store is SQL based.

## Database Migrations

### Adding new database field example

The general steps are:

1. Update `model.py` with new field
2. Run `flask db migrate -m 'added column title to plan model'` - which generates a new migration file
   The migration file will be in `./migrations/versions/<hash>_added_column_title_to.py`
3. Update the migration , check it is correct (we generally *dont* add a `down` migration, see other migration files for an example).
  Warning: It is likley the generation migratino will have more/less infromatino than needed- edit it to be correct
  Note: We used to have to use `op.batch_alter_table` however that is no longer needed ([thanks sqlalchemy!](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/support.html))
4. Apply the migration to your local database: `flask db upgrade`
5. Test (+write test), commit and push

# How new shops are created

1. New shop owner submits a form to create a new shop which hits `/start-building` endpoint
2. Shop is created and a new shop is started (Shop owner sees *"Please wait"*)
3. New Shop is ready
4. Shop owner is automatically redirected to the new shop, loged in using automated one-time login


# Saas Deployment

## Architecture

### Subscribie `shop`

Every shop owner gets a deployed flask application, with its own database.

### [`stripe-connect-account-announcer`](https://github.com/Subscribie/stripe-connect-account-announcer)

If a Subscribie `shop` connects to Stripe (it does not have to), then the `shop` will announce it's [Stripe connect id](https://stripe.com/docs/connect/authentication#stripe-account-header) to the `stripe-connect-account-announcer`.

The `stripe-connect-account-announcer` stores the Stripe connect id, so that when Stripe webhook events
arrive, the `stripe-connect-webhook-endpoint-router` knows which `shop` to send the events to. 

### [`stripe-connect-webhook-endpoint-router`](https://github.com/Subscribie/stripe-connect-webhook-endpoint-router)

A Stripe webhook endpoint.
Receives [Stripe webhook events](https://stripe.com/docs/webhooks#webhooks-def), which,

1. Inspects the [Stripe connect id](https://stripe.com/docs/connect/authentication#stripe-account-header) from the webhook request
2. Looks up the Stripe connect id (which has been stored by the `stripe-connect-account-announcer`)
3. Forwards the webhook event (e.g. [checkout-session-completed](stripe-connect-account-announcer)) to the correct Subscribie `shop`
4. The `shop` [verifies the webhook from Stripe](https://stripe.com/docs/webhooks/signatures), and processes the event.

> Note, in previous implementations there was one webhook endpoint per shop- this isn't compatible with Stripe when using Stripe Connect because there's a limmit on the number of webhooks, and connect events need to be routed based on their Stripe connect id anyway, hence the `stripe-connect-webhook-endpoint-router` performs this role.

#### Failure modes:

If the `stripe-connect-account-announcer` suffers an outage, this means new shops can't announce their Stripe account to `stripe-connect-webhook-endpoint-router` meaning, when a new Stripe event arrives from Stripe, then, Subscribie's `stripe-connect-webhook-endpoint-router` would not know which shop to send it to. Stripe [automatically retries the delivery of events](https://stripe.com/docs/webhooks/best-practices#retry-logic) which allows time for the system to recover in an outage.

## Application server: uwsgi

[uWSGI](https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is used to run the application services.

Subscribie Saas uses the following key compoent of uwsgi: [Emperor mode](https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Emperor.html).

uWSGI **Emperor mode** starts and manages all running Subscribie shops as `uWSGI` vassals.

> "If the emperor dies, all the vassals die."<br />
   -[Emperor mode](https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Emperor.html)

<br />


<details>
  <summary>uWSGI - Emperor</summary>
  - When a new shop is created, the emperor notices a new shop, and starts it as a vassal.
  - Every Subscribie shop is a vassal of the emperor

</details>

<details>
  <summary>uWSGI - vassal-template</summary>
  - A vassal template is injected into every new shop by the emporor.
    - This avoids having to copy and paste the same config for every new shop.
    - It also means vassal config is in one place.
</details>
<br />
<br />


### Systemd services

<details>
<summary>subscribie</summary>
  The uWSGI emperor and the vassals it sawns is defined as a single systemd service called `subscribie`.
</details>


<details>
<summary>subscribie-deployer</summary>
  Responsible for listening for new Shop requests, and creating the Shop config which uWSGI needs to spawn a new Shop (aka uwsgi vassal).
</details>
<br />
<br />

### Optimisation

*Problem*: Every shop uses ~45mb of RAM. With lots of Shops the RAM usage can be high. Since shops are not receiving web traffic all the time we can stop them to reduce RAM usage.

*Solution*: uWSGI vassals are configured to be `OnDemandVassals` see [OnDemandVassals](https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/OnDemandVassals.html)
and also socket-activated (note that's *two* different things):

*Result*: A reduction of > 17Gb of ram observed on a busy node.

- OnDemandVassals: The application is not started until the first request is received.
- Socket-activation: If running idle with no requests after x secconds, the shop is stoped- but is re-activated when a request comes in for the shop

Socker activation is enabled by using the uWSGI feature `emperor-on-demand-extension = .socket` in the `emperor.ini` config.

OnDemandVassals is enable by using the following config in the injected vassal config for every shop:

```
# idle time in seconds
idle = 60
# kill the application after idle time is reached
die-on-idle = true
```
See: [Combining on demand vassals with `--idle` and `--die-on-idle`](https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/OnDemandVassals.html#combining-on-demand-vassals-with-idle-and-die-on-idle)

### Subscribie Saas other services

Needed components / services. Check the `.env.example` for each of them.

- A [redis instance](https://github.com/Subscribie/redis), listening on localhost only (unless [protected with iptables](https://github.com/Subscribie/redis#ip-tables-config-example))
- A subscribie site with the [Builder module](https://github.com/Subscribie/module-builder) installed. The builder module submits new sites for building
- [Subscribie deployer](https://github.com/Subscribie/subscribie-deployer) is an endpoint which listens for `POST` requests of new sites to be created. The [Builder module](https://github.com/Subscribie/module-builder) submits to this endpoint. The server requires [uwsgi](https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Install.html) to be installed. There is an example config in the [README](https://github.com/Subscribie/subscribie-deployer).
- [Stripe connect account announcer](https://github.com/Subscribie/stripe-connect-account-announcer) Each shop announces its [stripe connect account id](https://stripe.com/docs/api/connected_accounts) to a redis endpoing (key is the account id, value is the shop url)
- [Stripe webhook router](https://github.com/Subscribie/stripe-connect-webhook-endpoint-router) which routes webhooks to the correct shop

#### Checklist 

- [ ] A Redis hostname is set
- [ ] Redis is configured with password authentication
- [ ] Iptables are configured for redis
- [ ] Hostname is setup for stripe-connect-webhook-endpoint-router
- [ ] Hostname is setup for stripe-connect-account-announcer (listening on port 8001 by default)
