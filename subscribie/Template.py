    Set theme path and static assets path.

    Reminder on theme paths:

    Themes start from TEMPLATE_BASE_DIR e.g /tmp/themes
    You might have two themes:
      - /tmp/themes/themeOne
      - /tmp/themes/themeTwo

    All themes have a `static` folder for their assets,
    and a folder named the same as the theme name for the
    template files. e.g. For themeOne

      - /tmp/themes/themeOne/static (for static assets such as images, css)
      - /tmp/themes/themeOne/themeOne (for template files, such as layout.html)

    For themeTwo:

      - /tmp/themes/themeTwo/static (for static assets such as images, css)
      - /tmp/themes/themeOne/themeTwo (for template files, such as layout.html)
