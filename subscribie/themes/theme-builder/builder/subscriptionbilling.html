<h1>Subscription Billing</h1>

can create weekly, monthly or yearly recuring charges to your customers</p>

</ul>

<h2>Web based subscription billing software</h2>

<p>To get started, you simply define the plans you want to sell. 
For example: Bronze, Silver and Gold packages. You can then set monthly
weekly or yearly prices for the plans. You may also take an initial 
up-front one-off fee from your customers (for example, an administration
fee) which is only charged at the beginning of their subscription</p>


<h2>How does it work</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Create the subscription plans you want to sell</li> 
  <li>We generate a sign-up website for you</li>
  <li>You customers sign-up- and you can manange the subscription</li>
</ul>

<h2>Subscription Management</h2>

<p>After you have subscribers, you can manage their payments (paid/failed/up-comming)
and view invoices associated with their payments. A pdf invoice is generated for 
each payment from your customers for every transaction.</p>

<p>If you're posting products, you can easily mark the subscription as 'fulfilled'
so you know which subscriptions you've already processed.</p>
