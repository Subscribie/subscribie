    <h3>Flexible Subscription Options</h3>
    <p>In addition to recurring payments you may also collect one-off payments by creating plans which only require one payment.
    This useful for trials or taster items depending if your subscription is a physical product or a service- both are supported. 
    
     It's posible for you to pause subscription, which makes it easier to retain customers who wish to put their subscription on hold, but return in the future.
