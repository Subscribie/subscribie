    <p>Subscribe subscription software makes it easy to setup subscriptions and collect recurring payments from your customers.</p>

    <p>With our web based <a href="https://subscriptionwebsitebuilder.co.uk/start-building">subscription software</a> you may create plans, and charge weekly, 
        monthly or yearly amounts to your customers. The software allows you to keep track of 
        payments received, mark them as fulfilled, and generates PDF invoices which may be sent you customers.  
    </p>

    <h2>Flexible Subscription Options</h2>
    <p>In addition to recurring payments you may also collect one-off payments by creating plans which only require one payment.
    This useful for trials or taster items depending if your subscription is a physical product or a service- both are supported. 
    
     It's possible for you to pause subscription, which makes it easier to retain customers who wish to put their subscription on hold, but return in the future.
