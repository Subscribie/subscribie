<br>
	    <h3>How do I login?</h3>
	    <p>Visit your shop URL, press 'login' and enter your email address.
	       You will receive an email with a link which logs you into your shop.
	       We don't store passwords at Subscribie, so you're more safe from
	       password theft.</p>
<br>

	    <h3>What is my shop url?</h3>
	    <p>We make your shop URL out of the business name you enter during the sign-up process.
	        After sign-up is complete you will be able to find your shop URL in the Welcome Email
	        you receive from us.</p>
<br>

	    <h3>Can I use Subscribie with my existing website?</h3>
	    <p>
	    Yes. You don't need to have an existing website, but if you do, then 
	    you can embed your subscription website into an existing website using
	    the 'embed' option from your shops dashboard.
	    </p>
	
<br>
	    <h3>When I get orders, how will I see them and track them?</h3>
	    <p>
	    New orders appear as a new customer on the customers list on your 
	    shop dashboard. Also, there's a transactions list to see payments which have
	    came through, and also invoices generated.
	    </p>
	
<br>
	    <h3>Can I take order notes from customers?</h3>
	    <p>
	    Yes. For each subscription plan you sell, you can choose to request customers
	    leave a note alongside their order. You can then see these on you shop 
	    dashboard under 'order notes'.
	    </p>
	
<br>
	    <h3>Is it possible to have both a recurring price and a one-off price on the same product?</h3>
	    <p>
	     Yes. Although this is a rare scenario, in this scenario, you would create the same item twice but with two titles:<br />
	     Title one: (Your product name) - Pay one-off <br />
	     Title two: (Your product name) - Pay monthly<br />
	      You would then configure only an up-front cost for item one, and 
	      a monthly fee for item two. Easy!
	    </p>
	
<br>
	    <h3>How many orders can Subscribie handle, does the price change?</h3>
	    <p>
	    There is no enforced limit on the number of orders your shop can take,
	    and the price remains the same regardless of how many orders your shop
	    processes.
	    </p>
	
<br>
	    <h3>May I use my own web address/domain name?</h3>
	    <p>Yes, after activating your shop you can either use an existing web address you 
	       own, or purchase an additional domain through us. We recommend 
	       <a href="https://domains.karmacomputing.co.uk" target="_blank">Karma Domains</a> 
	       for .co.uk subscription websites. You don't have to do this, all shops get a 
	       Subscribie branded web address for free!
