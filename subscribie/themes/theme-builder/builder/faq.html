    <h3>Can I use Subscribie with my existing website?</h3>
    <p>
    Yes. You don't need to have an existing website, but if you do, then 
    you can embed your subscription website into an existing website using
    the 'embed' option from your shops dashboard.

    <h3>When I get orders, how will I see them and track them?</h3>
    <p>
    New orders appear as a new customer on the customers list on your 
    shop dashboard. Also, there's a transactions list to see payments which have
    come through, and also invoices generated.

    dashboard under 'order notes'.

    <h3>Is it possible to have both a recurring price and a one-off price on the same product?</h3>
    <p>
     Yes. In this scenario, you can easily create two plans. For example:<br />
     Title one: (Your product name) - Pay one-off <br />
     Title two: (Your product name) - Pay monthly<br />
      You would then configure only an up-front cost for item one, and 
      a monthly fee for item two. Easy!

    and the price remains the same regardless of how many orders your shop
    processes.
