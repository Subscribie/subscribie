    <h2>Why a UK subscription builder?</h2>
    <p>There's nothing wrong with subscription sites offered in dollars and cents, but when 
     a service is built in a different country there is subtle differences.</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Using DirectDebit (a UK based system)</li>
     <li>Accounts and sort codes (not all using IBAN, or other codes)</li>
     <li>A subscription website builder UK made, better understands your needs</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Most website builders are based on and in the US markets. This 
     subscription website builder is made in the uk, and works well with the UK market.
    <p>

    <p>Payment systems in the UK work differently to the US, so having a UK website builder
    is beneficial <em>especially</em> when looking to build a subscription based websites 
    using direct debit.</p>

    <h2>Easily add your subscription plans</h2>

       subscriptions to customers, and take repeat payments online using Direct Debit.</p>
