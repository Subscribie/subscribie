    In a rush? Head to the 
    <a href="https://subscriptionwebsitebuilder.co.uk/start-building">Start Building</a> page, 
    and within ten minutues you can generate a simple subscription website to sell your service 
    or items on subscription. You can specify a monthly fee, as well as up-front costs (for
    things such as set-up fees). 
    </p>

	<li> <h3>Present Multiple Plans</h3> </li>
    <p>
	You can sell different plans / packages with different prices.
	For example, you can set a monthly cost, and an optional upfront fee. 
	typically you'd create two or three plans, but you're free to add 
	an unlimited number of packages if you wish.
    </p>

	<li><h3>Integrated Online Chat</h3></li>
    <p>
	Chat live with your existing and potential customer, with the free embeded 
	live chat service. We integrate with the popular "Tawk" live chat widget so
	you can stay in touch with customers easily and quickly.
    </p>
	
	<li>  <h3>Open Source Subscription Software (You can see the code)</h3></li>
    <p>
	We built Subscribie to solve a problem we had, we only charge to host 
	Subscribie for you (see <a href="https://subscriptionwebsitebuilder.co.uk/pricing">pricing</a>). 
	Most people love that, but if you want to you can also host it yourself (but you need to
	know how, or hire someone).<a href="https://subscriptionwebsitebuilder.co.uk/start-building">
        Start building now</a>, and we'll host for you.
    </p>
	
	<li><h3>Free Shop address</h3></li>
    <p>
	Every shop gets a free shop web address, so if you don't have a web address
	already, you can use ours for free. If you have an existing website address, 
	you can either embed Subscribie into your existing website, or ask for 
	help to connect your existing address to Subscribie.
    </p>

	<li> <h3>Got a website already? You can embed Subscribie into it</h3> </li>
    <p>You can embed Subscribie into an existing website. We provide a piece of
       code which you simply paste into your website. Just login your shops 
       admin dashboard, copy &amp; paste the code and you're done!

	<li><h3>Upload Files</h3></li>

    <p>You can upload files (documents, mp3 and video) and make them available for
       download for subscriber-access only. Once users have an account, you can upload content
       which appears on their dashboard when they log in. Access is protected 
       so that only subscribers who log in can download or access the files. 
    </p>
	
	<li>  <h3>Style and customise your shop</h3></li>
    <p>
    	With a little CSS know how, you can change the colours and style of
	your subscription website. This is really useful if you're wanting to embed your 
	subscription website into an existing site, or if you have brand
	colours you want to stick to. 
    </p>
    <h4>How it works</h4>
    <p>
    	From your subscription website dashboard, under modules click 'Style 
	Shop'. From here your able to insert custom style rules to change
	the existing colours. You'll need to know a little CSS for this, and it's super easy!
