## Choice Groups

Choice groups are for small variants of products which your customers may choose from to refine their plan, 

For example, by chosing a colour.

> It is important to understand that choud groups are *not* for affecting price. If you want to affect price, it is best to create
  an additional plan .e.g an `Extra large` plan.

Once you've added choice groups, you can add 'options'.

For example: You might create a choice group called "Colour", and add the options: `Red`, `Green`, `Blue`).
Finally, you would then assign your choice group to one or more plans. E.g. Perhaps you boxes available in those different colours.
