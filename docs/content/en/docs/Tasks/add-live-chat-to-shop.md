Step 2: Create a Tawk account and copy the end of the URL in the address bar

In our example, the part to be copied is *642bc7d94247f20fefe9b017* from the URL - https://dashboard.tawk.to/?lang=en#/dashboard/642bc7d94247f20fefe9b017

> This is the string of letters and numbers after the final "/" in the address bar.
