  Learn how you can view customer failed payments and number of retry attempts.

Failed payments do not need to be manually managed. You automatically receive a notification of a failed payment and when it will be retried again. All failed payments are automatically retried for a maximum of 5 times. Please reach out to your subscriber and ask them to keep their payment accounts in order before the next payment attempt.

If you'd like to know how to get your customer's information, check out our [documentation on subscriber information](https://docs.subscribie.co.uk/docs/tasks/export-subscribers-from-your-shop/).

## Steps to View Failed Payments

Step 1: In the Shop Dashboard, Look for *All Transactions / Manage Refunds* and click on *Failed Invoices*.

Step 2: Here you will see all of your attempted and failed invoices.
- Here, *attempts* denote the number of retries done, **retries are capped at 5**.
- To know which payments have completely failed and which payments are still ongoing, look at "*Next automatic charge attempt*".
- The date mentioned here is the next attempt to collect payments. **Please make sure your customer has their account in order before the next retry**.
- If it says never, retries will not be attempted on that account.
