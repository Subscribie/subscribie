How to set a cooling-off period for Plans. For example, a 14 day cooling-off period where there are no charges.


### What's the difference between a cooling-off period and a free trial period?

In a free trial period, you charge less (because you give away some days 'free',
compared to a cooling-off period, where you may want to delay taking payment until
*after* the cooling period has completed.

Some shop owners prefer to delay taking
payments until after the cooling-off period. They do this to reduce the time spent dealing with refunds
should they occur during the cooling-off period.
