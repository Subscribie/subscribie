### What's the difference between a cooling-off period and a free trial period?

In a free trial period, you charge less (because you give away some days 'free',
compared to a cooling-off period, where you may want to delay taking payment until
*after* the cooling period has completed.

Some shop owners prefer to delay taking
payments until after the cooling-off period. They do this to reduce the time spent dealing with refunds
should they occur during the cooling-off period.

## Steps to Add a Free Trial to a Subscription

### Step 1: Go to the *"Edit / Add Plans"* section in your Subscribie dashboard and choose Edit Plan.

>If you are creating a plan for the first time and want to add a free trial to it, click Add Plan

### Step 3: Set the number of days you would like to have under *"Free trial period number of days"*. For our example, we are setting the number of free trial days to 15. You can set it to how many days you would like to offer.

>If you clicked add plan, don't forget to fill out the information about your plan and set the number of days for the free trial.
