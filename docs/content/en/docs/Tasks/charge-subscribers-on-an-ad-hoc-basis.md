Learn How to Charge Subscribers on an Ad-hoc Basis

>Please Note, An ad hoc charge only applies to Subscribers who have Subscribed to at least one of your plans, which can be a regular plan (e.g. Â£10 a month) or a free trial. This is because Subscribie needs to obtain payment authorisation, which is done when they sign up for a plan. Free Plans do not require payment authorisation, so they cannot be used for ad hoc charges.

## Steps to Charge Subscribers on an Ad-hoc Basis

**Step 1:** In your dashboard go to **View Subscribers** under **My Subscribers.**

**Step 2:** Select the Subscriber you would like to add an Ad Hoc charge to. **Please note, An Ad Hoc Charge can only be charged to a customer that is subscribed to at least one of your plans.**

>Ad Hoc charges can not be charged to Free Subscribers (Subscribers who have subscribed to a free plan.)

**Step 4:** Enter the amount you would like to charge the customer under **Amount** and add a description in the **Description** text box and click **Charge Subscriber Now.**

>When Charging a customer, always add two extra Zeros at the end of the value. For instance, 2000 means 20.00, not 2000.00. This is a precautionary measure to prevent overcharging a customer.
