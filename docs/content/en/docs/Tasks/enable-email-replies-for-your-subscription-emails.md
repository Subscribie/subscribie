Subscribie sends a 'welcome' email to your Subscribers to confirm their
plan subscription.

By default, this is from a 'noreply' email address. However, you can change the reply-to address to be an email account you control to better support your customers.

## Steps to setup the reply-to email address

Step 1: Go to your shop dashboard and click on *E-mail settings.* Then, choose *Set reply-to email address* from the menu.
