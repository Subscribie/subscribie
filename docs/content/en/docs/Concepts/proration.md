  Proration (also known as "pro-rata") in Subscribie refers to the calculation of a charge according to the amount a Subscription has been used in relation to time.
  As a shop owner, from your `Admin dashboard` `->` `Edit Plans` screen, you can configure a Plan to either "Do not prorate" or "Prorate".

## Do not prorate

"Do not prorate" means to charge subscribers the full amount of the subscription, even if it ends before the period is over.


## Prorate (on)

Prorate (on) means in the event that a Subscription is cancelled before the subscription period is over, then *don't* charge the subscriber of this [Plan]({{< ref "Plan" >}} "Plan") the full 
amount, instead charge only the used amount of the current period.

For example, if a monthly subscription ends partway through the month, the final charge will be less since it is prorated based on the time used.
