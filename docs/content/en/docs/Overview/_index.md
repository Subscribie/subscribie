## What is it?

With Subscribie, after [creating an account](https://subscribie.co.uk/), you get an online service to setup and sell subscription plans for your business. You might be a business, a members club, or a software company seling charging license fees- wanting to collect subscription payments.

The primary goal of Subscribie is to **automate the boring**, and collecting / chasing payments for small businesses can waste a lot of time.

Subscribie **automates payment collection** and lets you focus on what matters- your business, your clients and customers. Sports Clubs, Golf Instructors, Software companies, Sales Teams, and Wine Clubs are all examples of business owners successully using Subscribie to automate their payment collectiion.

## Why do I want it?

Reasons people choose to use Subscribie:

* **Time Saver**: Before using Subscribie, a sports club was collecting payments manually which was a lot of effort for their members. They didn't want anything complicated, just simple automated payment collection. Another example is a sales team, which uses Subscribie to sign-up their members to plans which are on offer.

* **Simple & no coding skills required**: Subscribie is very easy to set-up and use, it only takes about 10 minutes to get started. More importantly, it's simple for your subscribers too, all they need to do is choose from the plans you create, and Subscribie will charge them accordingly.
